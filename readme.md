# 🧩 Bundle & Save – Frontend Assessment Task

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a frontend interactive product selector built as part of a 72-hour technical assessment. The component allows users to select between different bundle offers (1, 2, or 3 pairs), view pricing and discounts, and configure product variants (size and color) where applicable.

The layout and behavior are built strictly using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks or libraries were used. The UI is modeled to match the given Figma/video reference as closely as possible.
